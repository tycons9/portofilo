    <p>
      Hello! My name is <strong>Eyob Asefa</strong>. I am a 2nd-year,
      2nd-semester student studying <strong>Information Technology</strong> at
      <strong>Dire Dawa University</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am passionate about technology, innovation, and continuous learning.
      This page shares my journey, skills, and interests with you.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I was born and raised in <strong>Nekemte City</strong>. My interest in
      technology started during my high school years when I was introduced to
      programming and computer systems. I remember spending long hours solving
      coding challenges and learning how computers work. It was during this time
      that I realized how powerful technology can be in solving real-world
      problems. This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Information
      Technology at Dire Dawa University, where I am learning the fundamentals
      of software development, networking, and IT solutions.
    </p>
    <h2>Family Time</h2>
    <p>
      Spending time with my family is one of the most important aspects of my
      life. Whether it’s enjoying a meal together, going on a weekend trip, or
      just sharing stories, my family has always been a source of support and
      joy. They inspire me to stay grounded and remind me of the importance of
      balance in life. Below is a photo of me with my family, capturing one of
      those memorable moments we cherish.
